We are enraptured by the digital medium yet unable to gauge the consequences of our frenzy fully
Digital communication is abolishing distance and distances
The shitstorm swells in spaces where power and authority have weakened...shitstorms flourish where hierarchies have flattened out
The general distraction and dissipation characterizing society today prevent the epic energy of rage from arising
Everyone now thinks him- or herself free, even while working to death
All who participate in the capitalist system belong to it
The contemporary achievement subject is perpetrator and victim in one
No one rules the empire. It is the capitalist system itself, which encompasses everyone. Today, exploitation is possible without any domination at all
Those subject to the neoliberal economy do not constitute a "we" that is capable of collective action
The mounting categorization and atomization of society is making the space for collective action shrink
Solidarity is vanishing. Privatization now reaches into the depths of the soul itself.
The digital medium is in the course of abolishing all priestly classes
The imperative of transparency produces a strong compulsion to conform
Digital media are making our real counterparts fade more and more. Accordingly, digital communication is becoming more and more bodiless and faceless
A face on display does not belong to a counterpart with countenance -- one who casts a spell on, and captivates, the beholder. And so, today, the chains of love have given way to the hell of freedom
The digital medium is brining about an iconic reversal that is making images seem more alive, more beautiful, and better than reality itself
The religious experience is a threshold experience, an experience of the completely other...A society of positivity removes every threshold and every threshold experience by leveling everything to the same
Freedom will prove to have been merely an interlude. Freedom is felt when passing from one way of living to another -- until this too turns out to be a form of coercion
Neoliberalism represents a highly efficient, indeed an intelligent, system for exploiting freedom. Everything that belongs to practices and expressive forms of liberty - emotion, play and communication - comes to be exploited
Psychic maladies such as depression and burnout express a profound crisis of freedom. They represent pathological signs that freedom is now switching over into manifold forms of compulsion
Originally, being free meant being among friends
Industrial capitalism has now mutated into neoliberalism and financial capitalism, which are implementing a post-industrial, immaterial mode of production - instead of turning into communism
People who fail in the neoliberal achievement-society see themselves as responsible for their lot and feel shame instead of questioning the society or the system
The negativity of otherness or foreignness is de-interiorized and transformed into the positivity of communicable and consumable difference: "diversity"
Power that relies on violence does not represent power of the highest order...The greater power is, the more quietly it works. It just happens: it has no need to draw attention to itself
Today, power is assuming increasingly permissive forms. In its permissivity - indeed, in its friendliness - power is shedding its negativity and presenting itself as freedom
the capitalism of Like should come with a warning label: Protect me from what I want
Power that is smart and friendly does not operate frontally - i.e., against the will of those who are subject to it. Instead it guides their will to its own benefit. It says 'yes' more often than 'no'; it operates seductively, not repressively
Motivation, projects, competition, optimization and initiative represent features of the psychopolitical technology of domination that constitutes the neoliberal regime
Neoliberalism is not primarily concerned with the biological, the somatic the corporeal. It has discovered the psyche as a productive force
Perpetual self-optimization - as the exemplary neoliberal technology of the self - represents nothing so much as a highly efficient mode of domination and exploitation
Under neoliberalism, the technology of power takes on a subtle form. It does not lay hold of individuals directly. Instead it ensures that individuals act on themselves so that power relations are interiorized and then interpreted as freedom
It is not concern for the good life that drives self-optimization. Rather, self-optimization follows from systemic constraints - from the logic of quantifying success on the market
Endlessly working at self-improvement resembles the self-examination and self-monitoring of Protestantism, which represents a technology of subjectivation and domination in its own right
Without negativity, life degrades into "something dead." Indeed, negativity is what keeps life alive. Pain is constitutive for experience. Life that consists wholly of positive emotions and the sensation of "flow" is not human at all.
